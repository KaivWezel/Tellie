### Live scoreboard (progressively enhanced)

## User story

> I want to keep track of the time and score of a sportsgame to show interested people. They would also be able to comment on the game.

## Functionality

### Core functionality

The core of this app is to keep track of the score during a game and to show this to the audience so they can follow the gamescore live. For this app to work in its most basic form, 2 pages are needed:

1. The interface of the scoreboard
2. The scoreboard itself; visible to the crowd

### Enhancements

To enhance the experience I will be going to use javascript. This way I can add extra functionalities to the application. For example, I would like to add some real time comments
A function to not only track scores, but also time and other gamestats would be nice.

## Sketches & wireflow

These sketches were made with the core-functionality in mind. The pure HTML version of the application should be working and thus I have sketched that version.

## Features

Features that this application has:

- [x] Keep track of all live games
- [x] Update score of a game
- [x] View current score of a game
- [x] Comment on the score of a game
- [ ] Live chat function
- [ ] Live timer for the game

Some features have not been added due to time management issues and a few days of not too illness.
So in the future, a live chat function and timer would be nice. Dependant on the type of game/sport that is played, different implementations of a timer are necessary so that is something to look into.
