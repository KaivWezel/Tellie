### Live scoreboard (progressively enhanced)

## User story

> I want to keep track of the time and score of a sportsgame to show interested people. They would also be able to comment on the game.

## Functionality

### Core functionality

The core of this app is to keep track of the score during a game and to show this to the audience so they can follow the gamescore live. For this app to work in its most basic form, 2 pages are needed:

1. The interface of the scoreboard
2. The scoreboard itself; visible to the crowd
