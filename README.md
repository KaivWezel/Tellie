### Live scoreboard (progressively enhanced)

## User story

> I want to keep track of the time and score of a sportsgame to show interested people. They would also be able to comment on the game.

## Functionality

### Core functionality

The core of this app is to keep track of the score during a game and to show this to the audience so they can follow the gamescore live. For this app to work in its most basic form, 2 pages are needed:

1. The interface of the scoreboard
2. The scoreboard itself; visible to the crowd

### Enhancements

To enhance the experience I will be going to use javascript. This way I can add extra functionalities to the application. For example, I would like to add some real time commentsection/chatfunction.
A function to not only track scores, but also time and other gamestats would be nice.
